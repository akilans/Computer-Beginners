 # CS50 -2016 - Week 3 - Algorithm
 
  * Linear search - check all the element one by one
  * binary search - spilit array to half & check that element in that half 
  * Bubble sort - compare 1st & 2nd element and sort. Then 2nd & 3rd element and sort till last element. Then repeat the same thing again & again
  * selection sort - Find the smallest element & place it as first element. Then again find the 2 smallest element & place it as a second element keep on repeating
  * Insertion sort - take 2nd element & sort with 1st element. Then take 3rd element and compare with 1&2 element. Keep going till end

  * merge sort - sort right half elements & sort left half elements & merge those elements & sort
  * Recursive function call
